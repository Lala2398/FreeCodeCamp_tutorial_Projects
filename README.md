# FreeCodeCamp Projects Repository

Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp projects repository! This repository contains various projects I have completed as part of my journey through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis and responsive web design.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Data Analysis Projects

#### [Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/Lala2398/FreeCodeCamp_tutorial_Projects/tree/main/DataAnalysiswith_Python/mean_var_std_project)
- **Description:** A calculator that computes the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given dataset.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy
- **Files:**
  - `mean_var_std.py`: The main script containing the implementation.

#### [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/Lala2398/FreeCodeCamp_tutorial_Projects/tree/main/DataAnalysiswith_Python/Data_analysis_project_demographics)
- **Description:** Analyzes demographic data to provide insights and statistics, such as average age, gender distribution, and more.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas
- **Files:**
  - `demographics.py`: The main script for demographic data analysis.
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

### 2. Responsive Web Design Project

#### [Cat Photo App](https://github.com/Lala2398/FreeCodeCamp_tutorial_Projects/tree/main/ResponsiveWebDesign/Cat%20Photo%20App%20with%20HTML)
- **Description:** A responsive web application that showcases cat photos using HTML.
- **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS
- **Files:**
  - `CatPhotoApp.html`: The main HTML file for the cat photo app.
  - `Cat_photo_app.png`: Photo of project

 ### 3. Scientific Computing with Python (Beta) [Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Lala2398/scientific-computing-with-python-v7)

 #### [Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher](https://github.com/Lala2398/FreeCodeCamp_tutorial_Projects/blob/main/Scientific%20Computing%20with%20Python%20(Beta)/Learn_String_Manipulation_by_Building_a_Cipher.py) 
 - **Description:** A cipher is a method used to encrypt or encode information to keep it secure from unauthorized access. It transforms readable data (plaintext) into a format that is unreadable (ciphertext), and the process can be reversed to retrieve the original data.
 - **Features:** 
     - Encryption: Convert plaintext into ciphertext using a keyword.
     - Decryption: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext using the same keyword.
     - Handles non-letter characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) by leaving them unchanged.
- **Requirements:** Python 3.x

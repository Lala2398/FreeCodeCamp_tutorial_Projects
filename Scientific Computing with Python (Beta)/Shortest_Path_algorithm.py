#Task : 
#Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that developers use to perform calculations and solve computational problems.
#In this project, you'll learn how to use functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionary comprehensions to implement a Shortest Path algorithm.

#What is Shortest Path? : 
# The shortest path refers to the minimum distance or cost required to travel from one node (or point) to another in a graph. 
#This is widely used in computer science, mathematics, and real-world applications like navigation systems, network routing, and logistics. 
#Algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and A (A-star)* are commonly used to solve shortest path problems in graphs.
